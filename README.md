## About

Reproducible micromagnetics is an organisation where:

- Jupyter notebooks, reproducing results from different publications, can be hosted 

- All notebooks hosted in this organisation can be run in the cloud and the results reproduced by anybody

## How to use this repository

In order to use this repository as a template for reproducing the results from a publication, please follow the following steps:

1. Please clone this repository
2. Add the Ubermag notebooks to the `ipynb/` directory
3. Change the list of notebooks in `ipynb/index.ipynb`
4. If your notebooks require any other packages to be installed, which are not part of Ubermag, please add them to `environment.yml`. In order to make sure your work is reproducible in the future, please fix the package versions in `environment.yml`.
5. Change the LICENSE file if required
6. Push to a new GitHub repository and modify the URLs in `README.md`
7. Change the `README.md` file

## Reproducibility guidelines

There are several guidelines to keep in mind when publising your data/computing scripts:

1. The repository should contain all the data and computing scripts as well as the data analysis and visualisation code. Ideally, notebooks should reproduce all images in the publication.
2. In order to make sure that the notebooks can be run in the future, the versions of packages should be specified in `environment.yml`.
3. Very often papers deal with large simulations or they explore large parameter spaces. This makes them difficult to reproduce, because the simulation time is too long for them to be run in the cloud and inside Jupyter notebook. The recommendation in this case is to have a reproducibility script which provides a minimalistic example or a simulation at one parameter space point.

## Binder

Jupyter notebooks hosted in this repository can be used in the cloud via Binder. This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine. To access Binder, use this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/reproducible-micromagnetics/example/master?filepath=index.ipynb).
